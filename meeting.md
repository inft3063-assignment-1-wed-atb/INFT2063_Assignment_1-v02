# Group Meeting 

There were four main meetings that were made throughout the assignment. Each meeting we discussed and assigned each other tasks that we needed to do. Each meeting corresponded with each milestone, hence there being four total meetings. The contents of each meeting is summarised below.

## Meeting 1 (Milestone 1 - 60 min)
During this meeting, we discussed which group member was responsible for the bug fixes in milestone 1. We came to the following conclusion:
  
* **Anthony:**
  * Incorrect change values
  * No ending cash register balance displayed

* **Tin:**
  * Makefile compilation error
  * Lack of dollar signs before cash values

* **Bijay:**
  * Spelling error prompts

## Meeting 2 (Milestone 2 - 60 min)
For this meeting, again, we discussed which issues each group member were responsible for:

* **Anthony:**
  * Removal of cash register balance display after each transaction
  * Error handling

* **Tin:**
  * Implementing transaction confirmation
  * Creating a receipt

* **Bijay:**
  * Support for multi item transaction
  * Add a welcome message

We also had issues that each of us all had to participate and contribute in:
* Modifying the makefile to include creation of JAR
* Creating a new branch in another human language
